This is basically just a Fintwit (Financial Twitter) shitposting bot I made over the course of like a few hours, years ago, and have slightly updated or tweaked it a few times since then.


To use this bot for yourself, simply clone the repo, then add a file called "Keys.json", and format it as below:

{
  "TwitterKey": "Key Here",
  "TwitterSecret": "Secret Here",
  "AlpacaKey": "Key Here",
  "AlpacaSecret": "Secret Here",
  "DiscordWebhookURL": "Full Discord Webhook URL Here",
  "TwitterHandle": "YourTwitterHandle"
}

It will then run properly, once you fill out your API keys and such. And obviously, give it a Discord webhook to post with.

Happy memes.
